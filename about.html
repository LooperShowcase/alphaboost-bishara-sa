      features have been added, including larger screen sizes, shooting video,
      waterproofing, the ability to install third-party mobile apps through an
      app store, and many accessibility features. Up to 2017, iPhones used a
      layout with a single button on the front panel that returns the user to
      the home screen. Since 2017, more expensive iPhone models have switched to
      a nearly bezel-less front screen design with app switching activated by
      gesture recognition. The iPhone is one of the two largest smartphone
      platforms in the world alongside Android, forming a large part of the
      luxury market. The iPhone has generated large profits for Apple, making it
      one of the world's most valuable publicly traded companies. The
      first-generation iPhone was described as "revolutionary" and a
      "game-changer" for the mobile phone industry and subsequent models have
      also garnered praise. The iPhone has been credited with popularizing the
      smartphone and slate form factor, and with creating a large market for
      smartphone apps, or "app economy". As of January 2017, Apple's App Store
      contained more than 2.2 million applications for the
      Apples grown from seed tend to be very different from those of their parents, and the resultant fruit frequently lacks desired characteristics. Generally, apple cultivars are propagated by clonal grafting onto rootstocks. Apple trees grown without rootstocks tend to be larger and much slower to fruit after planting. Rootstocks are used to control the speed of growth and the size of the resulting tree, allowing for easier harvesting.

  There are more than 7,500 known cultivars of apples. Different cultivars are bred for various tastes and uses, including cooking, eating raw, and cider production. Trees and fruit are prone to a number of fungal, bacterial, and pest problems, which can be controlled by a number of organic and non-organic means. In 2010, the fruit's genome was sequenced as part of research on disease control and selective breeding in apple production.
      An apple is an edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus domestica). Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe and were brought to North America by European colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek, and European Christian tradition.
